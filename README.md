# DID (Decentralized Identifiers)

The idea for this project comes from [W3C standard for DID](https://w3c.github.io/did-core/).

Project will consist of two parts, smart contact and front-end which will interact with smart contract.

The goal of this project would be to create decentralized system for managing identities.

## Functionalities

1. User will be able to create DID document.
2. User will be able to add public keys to its document.
3. User will be able to remove keys from document.
4. User will be able to delete DID document.
5. User and other third party system will be able to read DID document and build their functionalities on top of that.
